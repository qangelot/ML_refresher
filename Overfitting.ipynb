    "## The Problem of Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reduce the number of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually select which features to keep or use a model selection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of the parameters. Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features."

    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can reduce the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by increasing their cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without actually getting rid of these features or changing the form of our hypothesis, we can instead modify our cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also regularize all of our theta parameters in a single summation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}& min_\\theta\\ \\dfrac{1}{2m}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + \\lambda\\ \\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\t\\end{align*} \n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda is the regularization parameter. It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above cost function with the extra summation, we can smooth the output of our hypothesis function to reduce overfitting. If lambda is chosen to be too large, it may smooth out the function too much and cause underfitting.\n",
